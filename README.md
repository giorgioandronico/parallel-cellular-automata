# parallel-cellular-automata
University project where the task involved implementing parallel execution of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, using C++, OpenMP, and MPI.
The results were visualized using a C++ routine and the Allegro graphics library, reaching a **1.86 total speedup**.
Additionally, a similar task was carried out using CUDA and SciddicaT cellular automata, resulting in a speedup
of around **46.5**.
